# LASER-GUIDED-COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM
This project demonstrates a communication system using lasers and Morse code, implemented in C. With this system, users can transmit messages by encoding text into Morse code and sending it via a laser beam. Itâ€™s a great way to explore the basics of optical communication and understand how data can be transmitted through light.
